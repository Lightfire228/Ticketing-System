        <h2>Wahjudi</h2>
        <p>Paulus Wahjudi is truly a hero, a God amongst men. He's a life saver. You see, last year around finals I was super stressed. I just couldn't handle it, and went to the top of Smith to throw myself from the building. As I was on the edge, staring down those 7 stories, Paulus talked me down, and comforted me. 1 like 1 prayer </p>
